# Relevance Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed critical bug where the system generated completely irrelevant UI components because the original user query was never passed to the renderer. For example, "give me a recipe for tacos" would generate a "Project Portfolio" UI instead.

## Root Cause
The renderer only received abstract metadata (intent type, suggested components) but never saw the actual user question, causing it to generate generic, unrelated UI.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Loading States (`lib/loading-states.ts`)
- Added new `preparing` phase for mock data generation
- Progress: 55%, Message: "Preparing data"

### 2. Component Validators (`lib/component-validators.ts`)
- Added `validateRelevance()` function that:
  - Checks if key entities from user query appear in generated code
  - Detects generic placeholder terms (e.g., "example", "demo", "project portfolio")
  - Scores relevance 0-100, fails if < 60
  - Returns detailed issues list for debugging

### 3. Agent Prompts (`lib/agent-prompts.ts`)

#### Enhanced PLANNER_PROMPT
- Now extracts `contentContext`: Brief description of what user wants
- Now extracts `keyEntities`: Array of key nouns/entities from query
- Example: For "recipe for tacos" ‚Üí keyEntities: ["tacos", "recipe", "ingredients"]

#### Added DATA_GENERATION_PROMPT
- New prompt for generating realistic mock data when web search isn't needed
- Ensures data matches the specific user request
- Prevents generic placeholder content

#### Updated getRendererPrompt()
- Now accepts `userMessage` parameter
- Added prominent relevance warning at top:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RELEVANCE REQUIREMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
  
  You MUST generate a component that DIRECTLY ANSWERS this question:
  "{userMessage}"
  
  The component content, data, labels, and text MUST be relevant to this specific query.
  DO NOT generate generic examples - tailor everything to the user's question.
  ```

### 4. Agent Wrapper (`lib/agent-wrapper.ts`)

#### Updated Imports
- Added `validateRelevance` from component-validators
- Added `DATA_GENERATION_PROMPT` from agent-prompts

#### Added Mock Data Generation Phase
- After planning, if `needsWebSearch=false`:
  - Shows "Preparing data" loading state
  - Calls cursor-agent with DATA_GENERATION_PROMPT
  - Generates realistic example data matching user query
  - Logs generated mock data for debugging

#### Enhanced Renderer Input
- Renderer prompt now includes:
  - `USER REQUEST: "{userMessage}"` at the top
  - Content Context from planner
  - Key Entities from planner
  - Closing reminder: `Generate a component that directly answers: "{userMessage}"`

#### Added Relevance Validation
- After runtime safety check, before critic phase
- Validates generated component against user query and key entities
- Logs relevance score (0-100)
- Throws error if relevance < 60 with detailed issues
- Warns about any relevance issues even if passing

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
User: "give me a recipe for tacos"
‚Üì
Planner: { intent: "list", components: [...] }
‚Üì
Renderer receives: Intent=list, Components=[card, badge, accordion]
‚Üì
AI generates: Any random list UI ‚Üí "Project Portfolio" ‚ùå
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User: "give me a recipe for tacos"
‚Üì
Planner: { 
  intent: "list",
  contentContext: "recipe for tacos",
  keyEntities: ["tacos", "recipe", "ingredients"],
  needsWebSearch: false
}
‚Üì
Mock Data Generator: Generates realistic taco recipe data
‚Üì
Renderer receives: 
  - USER REQUEST: "give me a recipe for tacos"
  - Content Context: "recipe for tacos"
  - Key Entities: tacos, recipe, ingredients
  - Generated taco recipe data
‚Üì
AI generates: Taco recipe UI with ingredients & instructions ‚úÖ
‚Üì
Relevance Validator: Checks code contains "tacos", "recipe", "ingredients" ‚úÖ
```

## Testing

### Test Cases
Run these queries to verify the fix:

1. **Recipe**: "give me a recipe for tacos"
   - Should show taco recipe with ingredients and steps
   - Should NOT show generic projects or unrelated content

2. **Stock Data**: "show me Apple stock price"
   - Should fetch live data and show Apple stock metrics
   - Should NOT show generic stock examples

3. **Comparison**: "compare iPhone vs Samsung"
   - Should show phone comparison table
   - Should include iPhone and Samsung specifically

4. **Calculator**: "tip calculator for $50"
   - Should show tip calculator UI
   - Should include $50 as example or default

### Verification
- Check terminal logs for:
  - `üìã Plan:` - should show contentContext and keyEntities
  - `üìä Generated mock data:` - should show relevant data
  - `üéØ Relevance score:` - should be > 60
  - No "‚ùå Generated UI is not relevant" errors

## Impact

### Robustness Improvements
1. **Always Relevant**: User query is now passed through entire pipeline
2. **Context Aware**: Planner extracts semantic meaning, not just UI type
3. **Validated Output**: Multiple checks ensure relevance before showing to user
4. **Better Data**: Mock data generation for non-live queries
5. **Debuggable**: Extensive logging at each phase

### Error Prevention
- Catches irrelevant UI before rendering
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging
- Warns about potential issues even when passing
- Falls back gracefully if data generation fails

## Files Changed
- `lib/loading-states.ts` - Added 'preparing' phase
- `lib/component-validators.ts` - Added validateRelevance()
- `lib/agent-prompts.ts` - Enhanced prompts, added DATA_GENERATION_PROMPT
- `lib/agent-wrapper.ts` - Integrated all fixes into pipeline

## Next Steps
If issues persist:
1. Check cursor-agent model is responding correctly
2. Review logs for planner output - are keyEntities being extracted?
3. Check relevance scores - may need to adjust threshold
4. Verify mock data generation is producing relevant content
