# Real-Time Streaming Implementation

## Problem
The UI was showing "Agent thinking..." and then immediately displaying the result without showing intermediate progress steps. This was because the server action was collecting all events and returning them after completion, causing the client to just flash through them quickly.

## Solution
Implemented true real-time streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send progress updates to the client as they happen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `cursor-agent.ts`
- Added `generateStreamWithCallback()` method that accepts an `onEvent` callback
- The callback is invoked immediately for each event as it arrives from the cursor-agent process
- This enables real-time event processing instead of waiting for completion

### 2. Updated `agent-wrapper.ts`
- Modified `queryAgentStream()` to use `generateStreamWithCallback()`
- Progress events are processed in real-time and sent via the `onUpdate` callback
- Added `parseFinalResponse()` helper function to parse the agent's JSON output

### 3. Created `/app/api/stream/route.ts`
- New API route that handles streaming requests
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream progress updates to the client
- Calls `queryAgentStream()` and forwards events to the client in real-time

### 4. Updated `page.tsx`
- Changed `handleSubmit()` to use `fetch()` with streaming instead of server action
- Reads the SSE stream and updates UI state as each event arrives
- Progress steps now appear in real-time during agent execution

## How It Works

1. **User submits message** → Client calls `/api/stream` endpoint
2. **API route starts streaming** → Calls `queryAgentStream()` with callback
3. **Agent processes request** → Each event (tool calls, thinking, etc.) triggers callback
4. **Callback converts to progress step** → "Agent fetching stock data...", "Agent analyzing...", etc.
5. **SSE sends to client** → Progress message streamed to browser in real-time
6. **Client updates UI** → Loading step text updates immediately
7. **Final result** → Component rendered and displayed

## Benefits

- **Real-time feedback**: Users see what the agent is doing as it happens
- **Better UX**: Progress updates appear naturally, not in a quick flash
- **Transparency**: Users understand when data is being fetched vs analyzed
- **Scalability**: SSE is lightweight and well-supported across browsers

## Testing

To test the streaming functionality:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then try queries that involve tool usage:
- "What's the stock price of NVIDIA?" (will show "Agent fetching stock data...")
- "What's the weather in Tokyo?" (will show "Agent getting weather info...")
- "How do I make cookies?" (will show "Agent analyzing response...")
